Automated Mango Disease Diagnosis
Your project focuses on developing an automated mango disease diagnosis system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify five distinct fungal and bacterial diseases and assess their severity using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning approaches.

Supervised Learning:
* Uses CNN, MobileNet, VGG, ResNet to classify mango leaf diseases.
* Helps in identifying disease types based on pre-labeled training data.

Unsupervised Learning:
* Utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection to locate and segment infected areas.
* Determines the extent of infection and disease severity.
